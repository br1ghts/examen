examen is a fake operating system that lives in the terminal.
Not a framework. Not a productivity app. Not a dashboard.

It's a personal CLI environment where my tools, habits, and daily systems live in one place.

It exists to create structure, not complexity.
One interface. One flow. One space to think and work.

examen is the shell.
Everything else lives inside it.
